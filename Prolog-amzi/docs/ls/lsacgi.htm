<!AMZI_INDEX=CGI; Web Servers; HTML; Internet>The Amzi! Logic Server Common
Gateway Interface (CGI) interface allows you to integrate Prolog logic
with web servers through CGI scripts written in Prolog. The Prolog code
can read information from a Web form and dynamically generate HTML to send
back to the user.

<P>A straight-forward class of applications for the CGI-Amzi! interface
is intelligent form editors. Prolog code can be used to analyze user input
from forms and then, based on that analysis, generate either responses
or other HTML user input elements to gather or correct missing or wrong
information.

<P>Expert systems can be implemented that dynamically generate HTML forms
to query the user, and, based on user answers, either generate more questions
or provide answers in HTML to the user.

<P>Expert systems are just one form of intelligent interaction enabled
by the CGI-Amzi! interface. Others include intelligent tutorials, natural
language processing applications, database or other information retrieval,
and, of course, interactive games.

<P>WebLS is another Amzi! product that is an example of the type of application
you can implement using the CGI-Amzi! interface. WebLS is a custom rule
engine that uses a simple rule language to let webmasters add expertise
to their Web pages. The rule engine is written in Prolog and uses HTML
specified in WebLS question and answer fields to communicate with the user.

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Architecture</FONT></H2>
<!AMZI_INDEX=Architecture>CGI provides a way for an application to communicate
with a Web server. The Web server calls the CGI application when it receives
information from the user, and the CGI application can send generated HTML
back to the user through the Web server.

<P><IMG SRC="cgiarch.gif" HEIGHT=546 WIDTH=583>

<P>The executable file that the server calls is written in C, and is provided
with full source code. That program starts the Amzi! Logic Server and loads
the Prolog CGI script. Before calling the main entry point of the Prolog
script, the CGI executable program first gathers information from the HTML
form and asserts that information to the Prolog dynamic database. This
step is what allows the Prolog code to easily reason over the information
entered by the user in the incoming HTML form.

<P>The CGI executable than calls the Prolog portion of the CGI-Amzi! interface.
This is a Prolog wrapper that provides many of the bookkeeping functions
necessary for CGI. That Prolog program then calls predicates that are defined
in the user-written Prolog script. From this point, the user Prolog program
is processing the CGI data.

<P>The Prolog program communicates back with the CGI interface through a number 
  of extended predicates that are implemented in both the Prolog wrapper and C 
  executable program. 
<h2><font color="0000FF">Hello Prolog</font></h2>
<p><font color="0000FF"><!AMZI_INDEX=  Hello Prolog></font>Hello CGI is the simplist 
  CGI program. It simply displays a greeting. The source code is in samples/internet/cgi/hello.</p>
<p>Installing CGI programs can be complex, and depends on the web server you are 
  using. Regardless of the web server, the following tasks must be completed: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write your CGI script. Compile it and link it with acgi.plm into an .xpl 
    file. </li>
  <li>Copy the CGI script and the executable acgi[.exe] (from amzi/lsapis/cgi) 
    to the directory your web server runs CGI programs from (usually cgi-bin). 
  </li>
  <li>Rename acgi[.exe] to have the same name as your XPL file. For example, hellocgi.exe 
    runs hellocgi.xpl. </li>
  <li>Ensure the process that runs your web server can find the Amzi! Logic Server 
    (amzi.dll or libamzi.so). This might mean putting the library on your path 
    or another environment variable, or copying it to cgi-bin or the /lib directory. 
  </li>
  <li>If you are using a .cfg file, ensure the web server process can find it. 
    This might mean putting it in cgi-bin or having the AMZI_DIR environment variable 
    set for the web server process. </li>
  <li>Ensure your web server process and read and/or execute access to all of 
    the above files. </li>
</ol>
<p>To help in debugging CGI scripts, you will want to consult the error log files 
  for your server. Following are two sample set-ups. </p>
<h3><font color="#000080">Windows NT with Netscape FastTrack</font> </h3>
<p><!AMZI_INDEX=FastTrack>Copy the .xpl file, the .exe (copied 
  from acgi.exe), amzi.dll and amzi.cfg in the cgi-bin directory. </p>
<h3><font color="#000080">Solaris with Apache</font> </h3>
<p><!AMZI_INDEX=Apache>Copy the .xpl file and acgi (renamed) 
  to the /apache/cgi-bin directory. Use Apache directives to tell it where to 
  find libamzi.so or copy libamzi.so to /lib. Use the Apache setEnv or passEnv 
  directives to set the value of AMZI_DIR and put your amzi.cfg file in /amzi/config. 
</p>
<H2> <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Forms Example</FONT></H2>
<!AMZI_INDEX=CGI Interface; Infoform Sample>Infoform is a simple example of a 
form editting application. The full source is available in the samples/internet/cgi/infoform 
directory, and it is running on Amzi!'s Web site to gather user's information 
requests. 
<P>The main entry point looks at the CGI variable request_method, which
was asserted by the CGI executable shell, and calls processMethod with
its value. Usually a 'get' request is used when the user wants to receive
a form for the first time, and a 'post' request is used to submit information.
You can control which type of request is used by setting 'method=' in your
&lt;FORM ...> definition.
<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000080">cgiMain :-
&nbsp; cgi(request_method, RM),
&nbsp; processMethod(RM).
cgiMain :-
&nbsp; throw($cgiMain failed\n$).</FONT></PRE>
The predicate processMethod/1 calls various helper predicates to check
the information on the form and either thanks the user or gives them the
opportunity to edit and fix the inputs. It generates HTML for the output
form using the extended predicate cgiSend/1.
<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000080">%&nbsp;
% For the initial get, simply return our HTML form
%
processMethod('GET') :-
&nbsp; cgiSend($Content-type: text/html$),
&nbsp; cgiSend($$),
&nbsp; cgiSendLocalHTMLFile('infoform.htm').</FONT></PRE>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000080">%&nbsp;
% After the user has filled in the form, we need to check it, then&nbsp;
% send a response back.&nbsp;
%&nbsp;
processMethod('POST') :-&nbsp;
&nbsp; sendHeader,
&nbsp; checkFacts,
&nbsp; writeRequestLog,
&nbsp; cgiSend($Thank you! Your information request has been successfully submitted!$),
&nbsp; cgiSend($&lt;P>Return to &lt;A HREF="/index.html">Amzi!'s home page&lt;/A>.$),
&nbsp; sendFooter.
processMethod('POST') :-
&nbsp; cgiSend($&lt;P>Press the 'Back' or '&amp;lt;-' button on your browser to change your form and resubmit it.$),
&nbsp; sendFooter.</FONT></PRE>
Here is one of the checking predicates. It looks at the various fact/2
clauses that were asserted in the dynamic database by the CGI executable
shell. Each fact represents an input field that was filled in on the original
HTML form. In this case it sees if the user has requested a catalog or
newsletters. If not,then there is no potential problem. If so, then make
sure there is information entered for the three address fields.
<PRE><FONT COLOR="#000080">checkAddress :-
&nbsp; fact(request, RL),
&nbsp; not(member(catalog, RL)),
&nbsp; not(member(newsletters, RL)),
&nbsp; !.
checkAddress :-
&nbsp; fact(address1, A1),
&nbsp; fact(city, C1),
&nbsp; fact(country, C2),
&nbsp; !.
checkAddress :-
&nbsp; cgiSend($Please fill in your mailing address including street, city, region and country.$),
&nbsp; fail, !.</FONT></PRE>

<H2>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Implementation</FONT></H2>
<!AMZI_INDEX= acgi.pro; amzicgi.c; amzisub.c >The Amzi! implementation
supports the current CGI 1.1 standard.

<P>The CGI interface consists of two parts. First, there is a Prolog library
which provides the basic framework for the script and many supporting functions.
Second, there is a C program that invokes the script framework in the Prolog
library and also provides some additional supporting functions. The files
are:
<UL>
  <LI> acgi.pro - The script framework and supporting functions</LI>

  <LI> amzicgi.c, amzisub.c- The executable C program that invokes the Prolog 
    script</LI>
</UL>
In the samples/internet/cgi subdirectory, you will find an examples that use the 
CGI interface. 
<H2>
<A NAME="BuildingTheCProgram"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Building the C
Program</FONT></H2>
<!AMZI_INDEX= amzicgi.c; amzisub.c; CGI Interface>The first step is to compile 
and link amzicgi.c and amzisub.c into an executable. This is provided in amzi/lsapis/cgi/acgi[.exe].
<p>As currently written, the C program loads an .xpl file with the same name. 
  For example, acgi.exe will load acgi.xpl. </p>
<H2>
<A NAME="WritingThePrologScript"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Writing the
Prolog Script</FONT></H2>
<!AMZI_INDEX= CGI Interface; cgiStart; cgiLoad; cgiMain; cgiErrorNote>The second 
step is to write a Prolog script that conforms to the framework provided in acgi.pro. 
You need to define the following predicates: 
<DL>
<DT>
cgiLoad/0</DT>

<DD>
This predicate needs to consult or load any external Prolog modules, rule
sets or logic-bases. All the cgi and system variables are already asserted
into the dynamic database and the output file has been opened.</DD>

<DT>
cgiMain/0</DT>

<DD>
This is your main script which processes get and post requests from forms.</DD>

<DT>
cgiErrorNote/0</DT>

<DD>
This outputs additional information (via cgiSend) when an unexpected but
fatal error occurs. Generally you will want to output who to contact about
the problem.</DD>
</DL>

<H2>
<A NAME="CGIVariables"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">CGI Variables</FONT></H2>
<!AMZI_INDEX= CGI Variables><FONT COLOR="#000000">Within your CGI script (cgiMain) 
you will want to access the values entered into the forms. These are all dynamically 
asserted as:</FONT> 
<blockquote>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="#000080">fact(<I>field_name</I>, <I>value</I>)</FONT></PRE>
</blockquote>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">The field names and values are Prolog atoms.</FONT> 
<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">You script can also access the values of many
CGI variables. The Amzi! implementation uses lowercase versions of the
standard CGI names (replacing spaces with underscores) and create predicates
of arity 2 representing each value. For example:</FONT>
<blockquote>
  <PRE><FONT COLOR="#000080">cgi(content_length, $1462$)</FONT></PRE>
</blockquote>
All cgi, extraheader and accept variables have string values. All system
variables have atom values.

<P>The following table lists the possible CGI variables that may be set.
Web servers differ in the variables they set and the format of the values
they use.

<DL>
<DT>
'Log File'</DT>

<DD>
This is the name of the file to write logging information to (via cgiLog).
It is the pathname passed to the operating system to open the file. It
must be an atom. If you have not defined a log file, then all calls to
cgiLog are ignored.</DD>

<!AMZI_INDEX= CGI Predicates>All CGI predicates provided by A5CGI.PRO and
by amzisub.c begin with 'cgi'. They are:
<DL>
<DT>
<!AMZI_INDEX=cgiExpandChars>cgiExpandChars(InputList, OutputList)</DT>

<DD>
Given a character list, these clauses expand special characters into their
proper HTML representations, e.g. > becomes &amp;gt; This could be used
by the error handler when reporting syntax (read) errors as the buffer
contains parts of the logic-base which include HTML tags which are not
to be interpreted, simply displayed.</DD>

<DT>
<!AMZI_INDEX=cgiSend>cgiSend(ListOrTerm)</DT>

<DD>
Outputs the list of terms or the term (which may be a string, atom, number,
etc. to the output file.</DD>

<DT>
<!AMZI_INDEX=cgiSendLocalHTMLFile>cgiSendLocalHTMLFile(FileName)</DT>

<DD>
Outputs the contents of an existing HTML text file to the output file.
You must output the header separately before calling this function. This
allows you to intermix "canned" HTML with generated HTML.</DD>

<DT>
<!AMZI_INDEX=cgiSendURL>cgiSendURL(URL)</DT>

<DD>
Tells the server to redirect to the specified URL.</DD>

<DT>
<!AMZI_INDEX=cgiAskField>cgiAskField(Key, Prompt, Length, Separator, DefaultValue)</DT>
