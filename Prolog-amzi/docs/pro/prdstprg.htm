<P><IMG SRC="arrowrt.gif" HEIGHT=18 WIDTH=18 ALIGN=BOTTOM> <I>This section
pertains only to users who are licensed to redistribute the Amzi! Prolog
Runtime.</I> </P>

<P><!AMZI_INDEX = Distributing; arun>In order package up your .plm files into
a distributable module, you first need to create an .xpl file for your application
as described in the section on alnk. </P>

<P>For command-line environments like the Windows Console, Solaris or Linux, you 
  need to create an .exe file. The simplist way to do this is to copy arun.exe 
  to <I>yourprog</I>.exe, where your compiled and linked Prolog module is called 
  <I>yourprog</I>.xpl. When <I>yourprog</I>.exe is run, it will automatically 
  run <I>yourprog</I>.xpl. The source code for arun is included in the src/acore/arun 
  directory. It is in file arun.cpp. A make file is included as well.</P>

<P>To ship your program to other users, the following files are required:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>A host program written in C/C++, Java,&nbsp;Delphi, Visual Basic or
any other language or tool that calls the Amzi! dynamic library runtime.
(For command-line programs, it can simply be the .exe file copied or created
from arun.)</LI>

  <LI>The Amzi! Prolog dynamic library runtime (.dll&nbsp;or .so):</LI>
  <UL>
    <LI>amzi.dll for Windows applications</LI>
    <LI>libamzi.so for Unix applications</LI>
  </UL>

<LI>Your .xpl file (from alnk, which contains a .plm file with a <B>main/0</B>
predicate).</LI>

  <LI>Optionally, any required Logic Server Extensions such as aosutils.lsx, asock.lsx, 
    aodbc.lsx, etc.</LI>

  <LI>Optionally, any other supporting files, such as user-modifiable .pro Files. 
  </LI>

<LI>Optionally, an .cfg file for setting stack sizes and other options.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>Your users simply copy these files into a directory and run the program
by typing its name at the operating system prompt. If that directory is
in their PATH statement, they can run your application from any directory
on their machine. </P>
