<P><!AMZI_INDEX = Linker; alnk>When a source file (.pro) is compiled the resulting 
  object code is a .plm file. Several .plm files may be combined into one .xpl 
  file using the Amzi! linker. The .xpl file contains all the code contained in 
  the .plm files, plus the Amzi! Prolog library, alib.plm (which must be located 
  in your PATH or AMZI_DIR environment variable). </P>

<P>Prolog executable (.xpl) files are executed directly the Amzi! runtime, either 
  from the operating system command line, the Windows-IDE or from a C/C++, Visual 
  Basic or other program. They cannot be executed under the listener. </P>

<H2><A NAME="StartingtheLinkerfromtheWindow"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Running
from the IDE</FONT></H2>

<P><!AMZI_INDEX = Linker; alnk; IDE>Normally the linker is invoked when
you build a project by either pressing the BLD button or selecting Build
/ Build from the menu. This will compile and link all the modified files
in the project. (See the <A HREF="prprojct.htm">Projects</A> section for
more details.)</P>

<P>To link a single file (or project), press the LNK&nbsp;button or select
Build / Link. You are presented with the standard &quot;file open&quot;
dialog box to select the project (.ppj) or object file (.plm) to be linked.
Usually you will use a project file, as most applications consists of more
than one object file. </P>

<P>When you use a project, all the files in the project will be linked together 
  (regardless of their extension, .pro or .plm). </P>

<P>The linker messages will be displayed in a window for you to peruse
when the link is completed. </P>

<H2><A NAME="StartingtheLinkerfromtheComman"></A><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Running
from the Command-Line</FONT></H2>

<P><!AMZI_INDEX = Linker; alnk; Command-Line>The Prolog linker is named alnk. 
  It may be invoked in one of three ways. The easiest is to simply type alnk and 
  respond to the prompts. For example, to create a load module called ducks.xpl 
  for stand-alone execution from the object modules duck1.plm and duck2.plm: </P>
