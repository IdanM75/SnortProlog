<h2> <font color="#0000FF">New Features</font></h2>
<p> The bulk of the work done for Amzi! 5.0 has been in reworking the underlying 
  structure of the system to better support our source code customers and to make 
  porting and support on multiple platforms easier. As such, Amzi! 5.0 provides 
  a better base for ongoing development that spans multiple platforms. </p>
<p>With Amzi! 5.0 we distinguish between the 'core' Amzi! + Logic Server system 
  and the various Logic Server extensions offered with the product. The core is 
  included for all platforms. </p>
<p>The extensions, as they always have been, are all open source, and are supported 
  to various degrees on the different platforms. We welcome any and all contributions 
  to the extensions portion of the system. </p>
<p>The core system includes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Prolog runtime engine, with full Unicode support, distributed as a dyanmic/shared 
    library (.dll or .so). It is a Prolog virtual machine that supports, like 
    Java, binary runtime portability across platforms. </li>
  <li> The console development tools, including the listener/debugger (alis), 
    the compiler (acmp), the Prolog linker (alnk), and the renameable runtime 
    (arun). Renamed versions of the runtime can be used to create console applications. 
  </li>
  <li> The Logic Server API for integrating Prolog with C/C++. This enables both 
    embedding of Prolog in C/C++ and the ability to develop extended predicates 
    (LSX libraries) for Prolog in C/C++. </li>
  <li>HTML documentation. </li>
</ul>
<p>Extensions are built on the core and include: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Graphical development environments. (e.g. the Windows IDE) </li>
  <li>Interfaces for various host languages to call the Logic Server API. (ex. 
    Java, VB and Delphi support) </li>
  <li> Extended predicate libraries. (e.g. ODBC, sockets) </li>
  <li>Samples.</li>
  <li>Applications (e.g. WebLS, SupportKT) </li>
</ul>
<h2><font color="#0000FF">Changes</font></h2>
<p>Initialization files are now called configuration files and have .cfg (instead 
  of .ini) extension.</p>
<h2><font color="#0000FF">Licensing</font></h2>
<p>This code can be downloaded under the Amzi! Personal license, which allows 
  for free non-commercial use. Professional licenses, allowing commercial use, 
  are available for $2500 per developer seat. Current 4.1 Professional license 
  subscribers can download and use the 5.0 version under the terms of their current 
  license agreement. </p>
<h2><font color="#0000FF">Support</font></h2>
<p>Support is by <a href="http://www.amzi.com/phorum/index.php">forums on our 
  website</a> or e-mail sent to support@amzi.com. Professional license holders 
  get priority support and should include their 5.0 or 4.1 license number in the
