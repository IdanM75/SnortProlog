<h2>
Hello Java Servlet</h2>
This servlet was developed with JRUN 2.2 and JDK 1.1.8. There is one source
code file named Hello.java. It supports both a GET and POST operation.
The GET puts up a simple form for you to enter the full pathname of HELLO.XPL.
The POST calls the Amzi! Logic Server and displays the result.
<p>In order to run this servlet, you need to do the following:
<ol>
<li>
Make sure that amzi4.dll and a4j_js11.dll are on the system PATH. (They
are both located in the amzi4\bin directory).</li>

<li>
Copy the amzi\ls directory tree from amzi\lib\java11 to jrun\2.2\classes.</li>

<li>
Copy Hello.class to jrun\2.2\jsm-default\services\jse\servlets (or whatever
directory you use to hold your servlets under JRUN).</li>
</ol>
