<h1>
Rule-Based Shipping Advisor Sample</h1>
Shipping notes on how to build an embedded rule-based system in Prolog.
<h2>
Design issues -</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Design of the rules</li>

<li>
Implementing in Prolog</li>

<li>
Implementing a rule language in Prolog</li>
</ul>
One of the major first issues is deciding whether or not the application
will make use of custom extensions to
<br>the Prolog language.
<p>Any host language application can query the Prolog rule base, assert
and retract facts, get answers back, but
<br>the host program is in control.&nbsp; Prolog only responds.
<p>Using C/C++, the developer can create custom extensions to Prolog that
allow Prolog to respond back to the application.
<p>The simplest example is use of a built-in messagebox predicate that
Prolog can use to query the user.
<h2>
Development steps -</h2>
Come up with some simple rules and getting it working in the interpreter.
<p>Playing with the ideas starts to give shape to the application.
<p>Write a Prolog front-end that simulates the interaction with the system
that the host program will have.&nbsp; This
<br>allows testing and debugging to proceed in the Prolog interactive environment.
<p>Example - the shipping application will be embedded in VB, so interaction
will be through assert facts, gathered
<br>from the VB front end.&nbsp; A main routine simulates this by gathering
inputs and calling the main predicates.
<p>Start simple - examples from shipper - try this and test it, if there's
bugs, then use the debugger to trace the
<br>output, understand the flow of control and the interaction of the rules
for a simple case.
<pre>main :-
&nbsp; get_inputs,
&nbsp; get_options.

get_options :-
&nbsp; option(Shipper, Service, Cost, Delivery),
&nbsp; write(Shipper:Service:Cost:Delivery), nl,
&nbsp; fail.
get_options.&nbsp;&nbsp;

get_inputs :-
&nbsp; prompt(weight, $What is the weight? $),
&nbsp; prompt(type, $What type of package (brochure, package)? $),
&nbsp; prompt(destination, $What is the destination? $).

prompt(Attr, Prompt) :-
&nbsp; write(Prompt),
&nbsp; read_string(Str),
&nbsp; string_term(Str, Val),
&nbsp; retractall(known(Attr, _)),
&nbsp; assert(known(Attr, Val)).

% Rules callable from VB

option(Shipper, Service, Cost, Delivery) :-
&nbsp; shipper(Shipper, Service, Cost, Delivery).

shipper('USMail', 'First Class', Cost, 'One or two days') :-
&nbsp; known(weight, W),
&nbsp; known(destination, D),
&nbsp; cost_usmail(W, D, Cost).

cost_usmail(W, 'USA', 32) :-
&nbsp; W =&lt; 1.
cost_usmail(W, 'USA', X) :-
&nbsp; X is 32 + 23 * (W - 1).
</pre>
Design points, its often useful to keep the information being reasoned
over separate from the rules and data
<br>of the expert system.
<p>In this case information is represented as simple attribute: value pairs,
such as weight:3.&nbsp; They are stored in a
<br>Prolog fact, known(Attr,Val).
<p>Utility predicates are written to maintain the information. They can
grow complex, to full frame-based systems.
