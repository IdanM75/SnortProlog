<h1>
Sports Scheduler Sample Application</h1>
The SSCHED sample application is designed to both illustrate the use of
Amzi! Prolog + Logic Server in scheduling applications and to provide a
useful tool for anyone who has to schedule a round robin tournament.&nbsp;
It is a simplified version of a program used to meet the extremely demanding
constraints of scheduling the Atlantic Coast Conference college basketball
schedule.&nbsp; (An article describing that application is available from
the Amzi! web site.)
<p>A round robin tournament is one in which each team/player plays each
other team/player one or two times, and is the basis for regular season
play for both professional and amateur sports.&nbsp; The problem is to
create a schedule of games to be played each round so that no team has
to play more than once a round and that at the end of N-1 rounds, where
N is the number of teams, each team has played each other team exactly
once.&nbsp; A round might correspond to a week with some sports, such as
football, or a matter of hours in a table tennis tournament.
<h2>
Application Overview</h2>
The Amzi! Sports Scheduling Demo is an abbreviated version of a program
written to create schedules for the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) basketball
season.&nbsp; The demo version does not enforce the strict constraints
of the ACC application.&nbsp; It simply enforces the constraints of a valid
round robin tournament, where each team plays each other once per cycle.
<h2>
Problem Representation</h2>
The Prolog code relied heavily on lists to represent the games to be scheduled,
the evolving schedule, and other items.&nbsp; Recursion is the primary
control structure used, so, in essence, the main loop of the program is
a classic recursion, with one Prolog rule for the boundary condition and
one for the recursive case.&nbsp; The two main lists passed through the
recursion are the list of games to be scheduled, and the evolving schedule.&nbsp;
(See List Processing inProlog at the bottom of this document.)
<p>Boundary Condition: When there are no more games to be scheduled, then
the schedule passed to this point is the final schedule.
<p>Recursive case: Take a days worth of games from the pending list and
put them in the schedule list.&nbsp; Test to make sure no constraints are
violated.&nbsp; If they are, backtrack, and if not make a recursive call
with the rest of the pending list and the evolving schedule list.
<p>Teams are represented by integers from 1 to N, where N is the number
of teams.&nbsp; Games are represented by pairs of away and home teams separated
by the '-' operator.&nbsp; For example 1-2 means 1 plays 2 at 2.&nbsp;
If there are an odd number of teams, a special team 0 is added, called
'bye', which is included in the schedule.
<p>Given this, one can write a first approximation of the main predicates.
<pre>main :-
&nbsp; schedule([1-2, 1-3, 1-4, ... 2-1, 2-3, ...], [], SCHEDULE)
&nbsp; output(SCHEDULE).

schedule([], SCHEDULE, SCHEDULE).
schedule(GAMES, PARTIAL_SCHEDULE, SCHEDULE) :-
&nbsp; pick(GAMES, DAYS_GAMES, GAMES_LEFT),
&nbsp; test(DAYS_GAMES, PARTIAL_SCHEDULE),
&nbsp; schedule(GAMES_LEFT, [DAYS_GAMES|PARTIAL_SCHEDULE], SCHEDULE).</pre>
pick - select match ups for a day in the schedule, and return the games
left to play.&nbsp; Each day has enough games so that every team is playing,
unless there is an odd number of teams, in which case the odd team out
has a bye.
<p>test - make sure the selected day's games combined with the partial
schedule so far don't violate any of the constraints.&nbsp; (This is not
used in the simple sports scheduler, but would be in one with more constraints.)
<p>This program has all of the control structure needed to search for a
valid schedule.&nbsp; The partial schedule starts out as the empty list.&nbsp;
At each level of recursion, games are picked to add to the schedule, and
then tested.&nbsp; If the games selected cause a constraint fault, then
the program backtracks into pick to get another possible set of games.
<p>If there are no sets of games available for a day, then the program
backtracks to the previous level of recursion, and tries a different set
of games.&nbsp; In this way, program execution continues forward and back,
until finally a valid schedule is produced or all the choices are exhausted.&nbsp;
For the simple sports schedule, the program generates a valid solution
without backtracking.
<h2>
General Sports Schedule Constraints</h2>

<p><br>There are some constraints that are inherent in a round robin scheduler.&nbsp;
One is that each team play each other team, usually twice.&nbsp; In the
first half of the season each team plays each other once, and in the second
half they repeat with home and away teams reversed.&nbsp; Another is that
no team can be playing two games at the same time.&nbsp; And another is
that the schedule should be as compact as possible, so if there are eight
teams, then there can be four games played each day.
<p>The teams are represented by a list of integers.&nbsp; The games/1 predicate
uses that list to generate a long list of all possible games.&nbsp; The
generated list looks like
<pre>[1-2, 1-3, ...2-1,&nbsp; 2-3, ...9-8]</pre>
Because this list includes all of the games that need to be scheduled,
the constraint about games is satisfied when all games on the list are
scheduled.
<p>One way to guarantee the right number of games for each day is to have
the loop that picks games for each day programmed with this information.&nbsp;
Another way is to provide a template for a day's games, in which the teams
are represented by variables.&nbsp; This is the approach taken in the scheduling
program.
<p>The template for a days games is a Prolog pattern, or structure.&nbsp;
If there were eight teams in the league, then a day's template would look
like
<pre>day(N, [T1-T2, T3-T4, T5-T6, T7-T8])</pre>
Notice that the second argument is a list with four elements.&nbsp; Each
is a possible game with different variables for each of the teams.&nbsp;
The predicate that picks games walks this list of game templates, unifying
the variables with actual teams.&nbsp; This guarantees each day has the
right number of games.
<p>The next constraint, that each team play each other once in the first
half and once in the second half, leads to the first efficiency in the
program.&nbsp; Because the first and second halves almost mirror each other,
but have a slight difference, separate predicates are implemented for filling
in each half.
<p>The difference between the two halves is that, when a game is picked
for the schedule in the first half, it's inverse game is also removed from
the games-left-to-play list and put on a list of games to be scheduled
in the second half.&nbsp; This ensures a rematch won't be considered during
the first half.
<p>The second half, of course, doesn't need to build this secondary list
of games.
<p>The overall structure of the program then looks like
<pre>schedule(SCHEDULE) :-
&nbsp; games(GAMES),
&nbsp; first_half(GAMES, [], SCHEDULE_1, [], GAMES_2),
&nbsp; second_half(GAMES_2, SCHEDULE_1, SCHEDULE).</pre>
A major efficiency is added to the search in the predicate that picks the
games for a given day.&nbsp; It makes a copy of the list of games that
it drastically trims as each game is selected.&nbsp; Once two teams are
playing, all other possible games with those two teams can be removed from
the list of potential games for that day.&nbsp; (Backtracking automatically
restores those games if necessary for further search.)
<pre>get_games([], _).</pre>

<pre>get_games([AWAY-HOME|GAMES], PICK_LIST) :-
&nbsp; deal(AWAY-HOME, PICK_LIST, PICKS_LEFT),
&nbsp; clean(AWAY-HOME, PICKS_LEFT, CLEANED_PICKS),
&nbsp; get_games(GAMES, CLEANED_PICKS).</pre>
The deal/3 predicate deletes an AWAY-HOME pattern from the list of games,
thus unifying the variables in the template with the value for AWAY and
HOME.&nbsp; The clean/3 predicate then uses those values to remove all
other possible games from the list of games that involves either of these
teams.
<p>This picking can be further improved by ensuring that the picks are
combinations of games rather than permutations.&nbsp; That is, once a four
game set has been picked for a day, there is no reason to try different
arrangements of those same four games.
<h2>
Useful Utilities for Scheduling</h2>
Two list utility predicates provide all of the power for the low level
predicates.&nbsp; One is delete/3 which deletes an element from a list
and returns the list of remaining elements.&nbsp; It, like member/2, is
very useful for generating selections from a list, but with the added advantage
that it returns the rest of the list as well, for further processing.
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>delete(A,[A|X],X).</pre>

<pre>delete(A,[B|X],[B|Y]) :- delete(A,X,Y).</pre>

<p><br>The pick/2 predicate is very similar, but has the useful behavior
of not including any elements in the returned list that occur before the
element selected.&nbsp; It is used to generate combinations, not permutations.
<br>&nbsp;
<pre>pick(A,[A|X],X).</pre>

<pre>pick(A,[B|X],Y) :- pick(A,X,Y).</pre>

<h2>
List Processing in Prolog</h2>
A list in Prolog is represented by elements separated by commas within
square brackets.&nbsp; A list of four arbitrary numbers in Prolog looks
like this:
<pre>[4, 23, 8, 17]</pre>
When working with lists, it is often convenient to be able to consider
the head element or elements of a list as distinct from the tail, or rest
of the list.&nbsp; The vertical bar is used for that effect.&nbsp; This
notation, in conjuction with Prolog variables, provides a powerful way
to describe list manipulation.&nbsp; Variables in Prolog, represented by
an initial upper case letter, are not simply representations of computer
memory locations as in most languages, but instead represent variables
in patterns that take on values based on Prolog's pattern-matching, called
unification.
<p>The most general form of pattern for matching against a list has two
variables, one which matches/unifies with the head element of the list,
and the other which unifies with the rest of the list.&nbsp; [H|T] is that
representation.
<p>Two Prolog terms, of which lists are a subset, can be explicitly unified
with the '=' operator.&nbsp; Given all this, the following Prolog
<br>statement
<pre>[H|T] = [4, 23, 8, 17]</pre>
triggers pattern matching that unifies (temporarily sets) the two variables
with these values:
<pre>H = 4</pre>

<pre>T = [23, 8, 17]</pre>
Note that a variable can unify with any arbitrarily complex Prolog term,
including a list, as T does in this example.
<p>The basic programmatic entity in Prolog is a predicate, which is composed
of one or more clauses.&nbsp; Let's consider a simple recursive list processing
predicate that checks if an element is a member of a list.&nbsp; It has
the two clauses listed below.&nbsp; The first is the boundary condition
and the second the recursive case.
<pre>member(H, [H|T]).</pre>

<pre>member(H, [X|T]) :- member(H, T).</pre>
The way Prolog executes, the first clause of a predicate is tried and if
it fails then the next clause is tried.&nbsp; In this case, the boundary
condition clause says that an element is a member of a list if its the
head of a list.&nbsp; The recursive clause says an element is a member
of a list if, the ':-' simple can often be read as 'if', its a member of
the tail of the list.
<p>One last note, if the value of a variable is not really needed, but
must be expressed to complete a pattern, then a simple _ is used to indicate
a variable whose value is unimportant.&nbsp; The member predicate is often
written using these 'anonymous' variables.
<pre>member(H, [H|_]).</pre>

<pre>member(H, [_|T]) :- member(H, T).</pre>
You call a Prolog predicate by presenting it with a pattern that has the
same name as the predicate.&nbsp; This is done implicitly after the ':-'
symbol of a clause, but can also be done directly in a Prolog listener
at the ?- prompt.&nbsp; For example
<pre>?- member(4, [4, 23, 8, 17])</pre>
will produce the answer yes right away, and
<pre>?- member(8, [4, 23, 8, 17])</pre>
will produce yes after two recursive calls from the second clause of member.&nbsp;
On the other hand
<pre>?- member(6, [4, 23, 8, 17])</pre>
will produce no.
<p>And now we get to the tricky part.&nbsp; In addition to the pattern-matching
and recursion presented so far, Prolog has a feature called backtracking.&nbsp;
Backtracking means that Prolog execution starts out in a forward direction,
but if any calls fail, such as the third example of calling member above,
execution backs up looking for other clauses in predicates that could be
tried.
<p>Backtracking, unification and recursion combine to provide some very
powerful effects in Prolog.&nbsp; Consider
<pre>member(X, [4, 23, 8, 17])</pre>
The first time it is called, X will be unified with '4', because of the
first clause.&nbsp; If for some reason failure occurs further down the
line, execution will backtrack to the call to member, and the second clause
will be tried instead, which recursively calls member again.&nbsp; It succeeds
the second time with X = '23', and, because it succeeds, execution restarts
in a forward direction with the new value of X.
<p>In this way, the member predicate can be used to generate values of
X from a given list.
<p>One more example will provide the foundation needed to understand the
schedule program.&nbsp; It is a predicate that reverses a list.&nbsp; For
example, if given the list [1,2,3,4] it will generate a new list [4,3,2,1].&nbsp;
Here is the definition of reverse.
<pre>reverse([], R, R).</pre>

<pre>reverse([H|T], PARTIAL, R) :-
&nbsp; reverse(T, [H|PARTIAL], R).</pre>
Like member, reverse works from the head of the list.&nbsp; Unlike member,
reverse builds an output list as it works it way recursively down the input
list.&nbsp; The second argument acts as an accumulator for the final result.&nbsp;
When reverse is first called, it has an empty list as the second argument.&nbsp;
Each level of recursion takes the head of the input list and makes it the
head ot the partial list for the next call.&nbsp; In this way the partial
list mirrors the input list, but in reverse.&nbsp; When the input list
is empty, the boundary condition clause executes, forcing unification between
the second and third arguments, thus setting the third argument to the
reversed list.
<p>This basic idea of using a accumulator list during recursion appears
in many places in the scheduler code.
