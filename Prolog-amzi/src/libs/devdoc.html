<p>The libs directory contains libraries of Prolog predicates implemented in Prolog. 
  The makefile calls Prolog to build each of the libraries, which winds up in 
  the abin directory.</p>
<p>Note that each of the libraries is commented with HTML, so that the source 
  code is also the documentation.</p>
