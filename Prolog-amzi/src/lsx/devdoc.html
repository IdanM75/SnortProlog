<h1>
lsx</h1>
Amzi! is designed to support plug-in like extensions of extended predicates,
called Logic Server extensions (LSX). These are predicates that become
part of the system, but are implemented in a non-Prolog language as system
libraries, shared objects under Unix and DLLs under Windows. They allow
Prolog to easily integrate with other systems.
<p>The makefile in the lsx directory calls the makefiles for the various
lsxs:
<p>sockets - A library providing predicates that give Prolog full sockets
programming support. (Windows, Linux)
<br>osutils - A library of OS dependent predicates, primarily for file/directory
handling. (Windows)
<h3>
Unix builds</h3>
Each LSX has it own makefile and can be made individually. You can make
all the LSXs from the lsx src directory with:
<pre>make -f makefile.X</pre>
where X is the platform for the build.
<h3>
Windows builds</h3>
The C++ projects are implemented using VC++. They can either be built individually
from the VC++ IDE, or you can go to the VC++ IDE and export, with the dependencies
box checked, the project makefile. Then you can call the lsx makefile in
batch using Borland's bmake:
<pre>bmake -f makefile.win</pre>
This will call nmake for each of the exported VC++ makefiles.
